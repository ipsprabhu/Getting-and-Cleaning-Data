Data transformation

The raw data sets are processed with run_analisys.R script to create a tidy data set.

Merge training and test sets

Test and training data (X_train.txt, X_test.txt), subject ids (subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt) and activity ids (y_train.txt, y_test.txt) are merged to obtain 
a single data set. Variables are labelled with the names assigned by original collectors (features.txt).

Extract mean and standard deviation variables

From the merged data set is extracted and intermediate data set with only the values of estimated mean (variables with labels that contain "mean") and 
standard deviation (variables with labels that contain "std").

Use descriptive activity names

A new column is added to intermediate data set with the activity description. Activity id column is used to look up descriptions in activity_labels.txt.

Label variables appropriately

Labels given from the original collectors were changed:  to obtain valid R names without parentheses, dashes and commas  to obtain more descriptive labels

Create a tidy data set

From the intermediate data set is created a final tidy data set where numeric variables are averaged for each activity and each subject.

The tidy data set contains 10299 observations with 81 variables divided in:
•an activity label (Activity): WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
•an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (Subject).
•a 79-feature vector with time and frequency domain signal variables
